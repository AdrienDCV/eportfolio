        content: `For several years now, I have been passionate about the world of motor racing.
        It all started when I heard a friend talking about Formula 1. Intrigued, I watched a few videos about the sport which, 
        although I had heard about it and watched it when I was younger, had never really interested me. So I watched one, 
        then two, then three videos, and before I knew it, I had quickly gone through the history of the premier class of motor racing. 
        From Fangio to Verstappen, I fell in love with the sport. I started following Formula 1 assiduously, then quickly opened up to other 
        disciplines such as endurance racing (World Endurance Championship), Formula 2 and even rallying (World Rally Championship), where I support 
        Haas F1 Team, Art Grand Prix and Toyota GAZOO Racing in WEC and WRC respectively.
        Beyond the roaring engines, it's the aerodynamics, mechanical engineering and constant pursuit of innovation that fascinate and excite me about this field.`

        content: `History, both French and world history, has always played a major role in my life, from my earliest childhood to the present day 
        and for many years to come. The more time passes, the more we learn about our past. Knowing and understanding the way of our predecessors were 
        living has always fascinated me. I cannot help but imagine the atmosphere that prevailed at a particular time, the difficulties endured by 
        the soldiers of 1914-18, the general surprise of the old world when Christopher Columbus discovered America (In fact, he did not discover the 
        continent ! The Vikings had already set foot on American soil long before the Conquistadors), the construction of the pyramids, the first human 
        civilisations, man's first steps on two legs and countless other events that have enriched and continue to enrich one of humanity's greatest 
        treasures. Knowing our past, its wonders but also its mistakes, allows us to better envisage our future. Knowing history also means knowing that 
        mistakes have been made in the past. It is essential to recognise the existence of these mistakes in order to learn from them so that they cannot 
        be repeated.`,

        content: `Like many of my interests, it was during my childhood (and almost from birth) that I developed a strong interest in aeronautics and aerospace. 
        It is a passion I share with my father (you could say I inherited it), who is also a great aviation enthusiast. I still remember little Adrien in nursery 
        school proclaiming loudly that he was going to ‘work in the control towers’ (at the time, I didn't know that the correct term was ‘air traffic controller’). 
        As for aerospace, I have always been intrigued by the mysteries of the universe in which our tiny planet floats elegantly.`
